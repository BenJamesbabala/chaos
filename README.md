The "James Gleick's Chaos" software
=============RELEASE INFORMATION=================

This is a free release of James Gleick's CHAOS, December 15, 1998.
The software was written primarily by Josh Gordon, Rudy Rucker and
John Walker for Autodesk, Inc., with Josh Gordon doing the lion's share
of the work.  It is our hope that this shareware release will allow
educators, students and dabblers to freely use our software.

The software was originally released by Autodesk, Inc., in 1990, and
was placed in copyright to Autodesk at that time.  When the product
went out of print in about 1992, Autodesk transferred intellectual
property rights for the product to James Gleick.  And Gleick has agreed
that the software can be freely released under a Gnu license.

This release has been prepared by Rudy Rucker, who can be reached at rudy@rudyrucker.com

The code is DOS and assembly code.  A makefile is in each subdirectory. The builds were originally compiled and assmebled using Turbo C and Tasm.

The code is in six directories, one for each of the five component Chaos programs, and one for the start Menu.
ATRS� is the directory with the "Strange Attractors" module, including the Lorenz attractor, the Logistic map, and others.
FRG� is the director with the "Fractal Foreries" module that uses fractals to create images resembling landscapes
GME� is the "Chaos Game" module that shows Barnsely fractals.
MAG� is the "Magnets and Pendulum" which emulates a chaotic physical motion.
MENU� has the code for the start menu screen
MND� is for the "Mandelbrot Sets" module which also include Julia sets, cubic Mandelbrot sets, and the so-called Rudy set.
TOYS� is for the "Toy Universe" module which shows cellular automata.

The code is written to work with a DOS GUI called Metashel, which is run before before the chaos program from the DOS command line.�A copy of metashel.exe is distributed with the Chaos 1998 release download. Metashel was an early 1980s TSR or "terminate and stay resident" program by MetaGraphics Software Corporation, then in Scotts Valley, CA.
