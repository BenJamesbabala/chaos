# James Gleick's CHAOS: The Software

This is a free release of the source, manual, and executables of a 1991 Autodesk DOS program that was called  "James Gleick's CHAOS: The Software." The software was written by Josh Gordon, Rudy Rucker and John Walker. Rucker wrote most of the algorithms, except for the Fractal Landscapes algorithms, which are by John Walker.  Josh Gordon did the interface, and much of the implementation of the algorithm code. The program was written in consultation with James Gleick about his brilliant book, <a href="https://around.com/books/"> <i>Chaos: Making a New Science</i> </a>. This release is under a Gnu license.

Downloads for the Release 1.1

<a href="https://github.com/rudyrucker/chaos/releases/download/v1.1-chaos/chaos_v1_1.zip">The CHAOS executables and parameter files.</a>

It's possible to run the Chaos program on any virtually any platform, inside a DOS shell called DOSBox. Details on the <a href="https://github.com/rudyrucker/chaos/releases/tag/v1.1-chaos">Release page</a>. 

You are free to alter the code and upload new versions. Or use our algorithms to spin off smaller programs. See our Chaos <a href="https://github.com/rudyrucker/chaos/"> GitHub repository</a> for the code online.

The biggest outstanding upgrades for Chaos might be: (1) Increase the resolution or pixel size of the display. (2) Elmimate our use of the old DOS TSR or "terminate and stay resident" program metashel.exe, made by MetaGraphics Software Corporation. Chaos uses metashel calls for its graphics.
